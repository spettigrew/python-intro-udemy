#------------------------------------------------------

#Numbers
 #int - whole numbers, no decimal points
 #float - numbers with decimal points
 #complex - x + y = j x is real, y is imaginary.
 # +, -, *, / and squaring. If it's not a number, it's an operation.

 # Arithmetic order
 # () - caluclate your parenthesis first
 # Exponents - if they exist
 # * and / - from left to right
 # + and - - from left to right

## Variable: to store values for processing. Python is a OOP (Object Oriented Programming), interpreted language. Every variable is an object.
## variable = value. Strings are immutable - can not change.
#-----------------------------------------------------------

## Lists - contain items of the same type. They are mutable. Start at the index of 0.
# slice - remove from the end of the list. Append - add to the end of the list.
# [:] = [] will clear a list

## Conditional statements
#if, if/else = elif. Inputs based on conditional statement. Elif writes another condition if the first if statement is false. Else catches what is not caught by the preceding conditions.
# for loop: for iterator_var in sequeence:
        #statement(s)
# range[start,stop,step] can be positive or negative, but not 0.
        #for i in range(5):
        #       print(i) : 0-5 printed.

        #for i in range(0, 10, 3)
        #       print(i) : 0,3,6,9 printed. 3 is the rate of increase.

        # a = ["I", "want", "to", "eat."]
        # for i in range(len(a)):
        #       print(i, a[i]) : 0-3 printed I, want, to eat.  

# sum(range(4)) : prints 6, 0+1+2+3=6

# Loops (for loop, while loop)
#Break, else, continue, loop. Break - to break loop. Continue - to continue with the next. Else - only when the loop is not ternminated by a break statement.
# while loop - test_expression:#Statements i +=1 increments, otherwise while loop will continure...forever!
